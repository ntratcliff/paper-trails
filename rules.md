# Paper Trails

## Rules

[Version 1](./CHANGELOG.md)

1-4 players (ymmv. I only tested with 1-2!)

### Overview

Paper Trails is a game about backpacking collaboratively with your friends while competing to have the best experience. If you play solo, it's more just a game about the latter. Manage your resources while you hop between campsites and ensure everyone gets safely back to the car.

### Setup

1. Shuffle the **Trail** and **Event** decks and place them near each other.

2. Place your player tokens at the **Car** on the board.

3. Give each player 4 tokens representing **Food**, **Water**, and **Gear**, respectively.

4. Set out some tokens to represent **Adventure Points** you can also use a calculator or pen and paper to keep track of your points.

5. Starting with the player who hiked most recently, each player draws 1 **Event** card and takes whatever actions necessary. Unless otherwise specified, place spent **Event** cards face up in a discard pile near the **Event** deck.

### Equipment

Every player starts with 4 tokens representing **Food**, **Water**, and **Gear**, respectively. This is your equipment.

You will gain and lose this equipment throughout the course of play but you may not have more than 6 of any kind of equipment. This is your "carrying capacity."

If you run out of equipment you risk having an **emergency**. See below for more details.

### Play

The player who hiked most recently starts their turn first. Proceed with turns clockwise (or counter-clockwise, I can't stop you) around the table.

#### On Your Turn

On your turn you may choose to:

- **Move** (you'll usually do this)
- **Rest** (remain where you are)
- **Trade** equipment with any party member sharing a tile with you (you can do this at any time in your turn). See **Trading** for more detail.

You can only **move** or **rest** once per turn, but you can **trade** at any time during your turn.

#### Moving

1. Resolve any **obstacles** on your current tile (if any). See **Obstacles** for more detail.

2. **Draw** a card from the **Trail** deck and resolve it. Resolution often means drawing and resolving more cards. Do this as many times as is necessary before moving on. If you can not meet the requirement for any card drawn during this phase (i.e. -1 water for Sun Exposure but you have no more water) you are in an **emergency**. See **Emergency** below.

2. **Move** up to a number of tiles equal to **1/2 of your gear** amount (rounded up). You may move forwards or backwards. You can not move backwards past a **Camp** or the **car**.

You may not move further than the next **Camp** before your party joins you on that tile. See **Camp** for more details.

#### Resting

Instead of moving, you may choose to rest at your current tile. You could do this to utilize a resource on that tile, wait up for a party member, avoid an emergency, etc.. It's up to you!

You do not draw any **Trail** cards while resting nor do you engage with any **obstacles**.

You can not **move** this turn if you **rest** (and vice versa).

#### Camp

The first player to arrive at camp earns **1 Adventure Point** and draws **1 Event** card.

Everyone in your party must arrive at the **camp** tile before you can sleep for the night and proceed to the next day.

Once everyone has arrived, everyone must spend **1 Water** and **1 Food** to make camp for the night.

Clear any markers from the last segment so you can use them in the next leg of your journey.

#### Obstacles

There are some cases where you are unable to move from the tile you're currently standing on without doing something to avoid an **obstacle**. You must pass this obstacle _before_ drawing your trail card. Follow the instructions given on the card of the particular obstruction. If you pass through a tile with an obstacle while moving you must either resolve the obstacle or stop moving at that tile.

#### Resources

Some **Event** cards result in a resource being placed on a tile on the board. If you share a tile with a resource, you may **rest** on your turn to utilize the resource.

#### Emergencies

If any member of your party fails to meet an equipment requirement (i.e. draws a card for -1 water with 0 water, or attempts to sleep without food/water), they are in an **emergency** and can do nothing other than **rest** or **trade** on their turn. Someone from the party must **trade** with them to resolve the emergency. Remember, everyone in your party must make it to the **car** to win the game.

#### Trading

At any point during your turn you may **trade** equipment points or items in your inventory with players that share a tile with you. A trade does not have to be equal. You may, for example, give a resource to your party member without taking anything in return.


#### Running out of cards

If there are no more **trail** or **event** cards left to draw, shuffle the discard pile to replace the deck.

### Arriving at the Car

The first member of the party to arrive at the car earns **3 adventure points**, followed by **2** for the 2nd, **1** for the 3rd, and none for the 4th. 

The player with the most adventure points after the final party member has arrived at the car wins!

In the case of a tie, the player with the most equipment beats the other. If there's still a tie... you tied!

### Solo Play

Playing Paper Trails, like backpacking, is possible to do alone--although it is a slightly different experience. You'll need to change a few things:

- Do not earn an **adventure point** when arriving at camp, because you did not beat anyone there! You must still draw an **event** card.
- Follow specific instructions on cards for solo play.
- The game is over if you have an **emergency** or run out of **gear** and can no longer move.

Win by reaching the car with 12 or more **adventure points**, then try for a high score!
