# Paper Trails

## Game Components

Follow these instructions to make your own Paper Trails game set.

### The Board

The board can be laid out in any way you'd like but should follow these rules:

- Must start and end at a **car** tile. It does not necessarily need to be the same car tile.
- Must have **3 camp** tiles.
- **camp** and **car** tiles must all have **10 blank** tiles between them.

For example, a simple board could look like this:

```
[car ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][camp]
[ ]                                    [ ]
[ ]                                    [ ]
[ ]                                    [ ]
[ ]                                    [ ]
[ ]                                    [ ]
[ ]                                    [ ]
[ ]                                    [ ]
[ ]                                    [ ]
[ ]                                    [ ]
[ ]                                    [ ]
[camp][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][camp]
```

Feel free to get creative!

#### Board markers

Some cards require markers be placed on the board to denote a special resource or obstacle on the tile. You will need:

- 3 markers for Reliable Stream
- 2 markers for Blocked Path
- 2 markers for River Crossing
- 2 markers for Cache

You can use whatever you'd like for these markers, just make sure you can tell what they mean!

### Tokens

You will need some way to keep track of **equipment** and **adventure points**.

#### Equipment

Each player can have up to 6 of each kind of equipment: **water**, **food**, and **gear**. This means you need up to **24 tokens for each type of equipment for 4 players**. 

Alternatively, you could use a **D6 die** to represent each type of equipment. In that case, each player should have **3 D6 and some way to keep track of which is which**. You could use different colored dice or make a card with labels for each die.

#### Adventure points

Players earn **adventure points** throughout the course of play. The number of points can vary quite a bit depending on how the game goes. Based on some quick napkin math, you should have **at least 60 tokens available for 4 players** and **no less than 20 for single player**.

You can also use a **calculator or pen and paper** to keep track of adventure points.

### Dice

You need at least 1 D6 dice for special rolls.

### Cards

Paper Trails has two types of cards: **trail** and **event**. They should be identifiable on the back as either **trail** or **event** cards.

You could make these cards by cutting index cards in half, or whatever else you'd like to do!
